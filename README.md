This repo consist of my solutions on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/u/soodoo/)

Currently I'm doing Top 150 questions by Python. As I was an ACM ICPC partipant for a period of time and I solved chanllenges by C/C++, everything is much is easier now, but after I solve a good amount of quetions I will switche to a low level language to get btter resutlt in runtime.
